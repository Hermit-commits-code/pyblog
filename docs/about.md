# About Me

Hi, I'm Joe. I build Python tools that focus on digital forensics and automation.

## My Journey

This blog started as a way to document the development of **Origin-Miner**, a tool I built to solve the "LLM Signature" problem in modern software development. I believe that as AI becomes more prevalent, understanding the *human* element in code becomes even more critical.

### What I'm Working On

* **Origin-Miner**: Continuing to refine the forensic scoring logic.
* **This Blog**: Sharing the "under the hood" details of my Python projects.
* **Automation**: Exploring ways to make the dev-to-deploy pipeline as invisible as possible.
